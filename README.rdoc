An extension to allow chingu to load tilemaps from the tiled map editor ( mapeditor.org )

To use

    map = TmxTileMap["filename.tmx"]
    
then simply add to your draw / update loop as with any other BasicGameObject
    
Directories that are automatically searched for filename.tmx (relative to the script) are

* "maps"
* "media/maps"
* "../media/maps"

Custom directories can be added in the usual chingu way
